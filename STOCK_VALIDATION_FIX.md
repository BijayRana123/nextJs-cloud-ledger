# Stock Validation Issue Fix

## Problem
When trying to save a sales voucher with insufficient stock (e.g., selling 1 unit of "dress" when stock is 0), the system was returning a 400 error but the frontend wasn't handling it gracefully. Users would see the error in the network logs but no proper user interface feedback.

## Root Cause
The sales form (`app/dashboard/sales/add-sales-voucher/page.jsx`) was not implementing the stock validation user interface that was designed for the system. It was treating stock validation errors as generic API errors.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Frontend Error Handling Enhancement
**File:** `app/dashboard/sales/add-sales-voucher/page.jsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `StockWarningModal` import and state management
- Enhanced error handling in `handleSubmit` to detect stock validation errors
- Added proper loading states and user feedback
- Implemented bypass mechanism for businesses that allow overselling

**New Features:**
- **Stock Error Modal**: Shows when there's insufficient stock
- **Stock Warning Modal**: Shows when stock will be low after sale
- **Force Save Option**: Allows bypassing stock validation when needed
- **Better UX**: Loading states and clear error messages

### 2. API Enhancement for Bypass Option
**File:** `app/api/organization/sales-vouchers/route.js`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `bypassStockValidation` parameter support
- Enhanced error response to include `bypassOption` flag
- Maintains existing stock validation logic while allowing override

### 3. Modal Component Enhancement
**File:** `components/StockWarningModal.jsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `allowBypass` prop and `onForceSubmit` handler
- Added "Force Save (Allow Overselling)" button for stock errors
- Maintains existing behavior for warnings vs errors

### 4. New API Endpoint
**File:** `app/api/organization/check-stock/route.js`

**Purpose:** Pre-validation of stock levels before form submission (optional feature)

## How It Works Now

### Normal Flow
1. User fills sales form and clicks "Save"
2. API validates stock levels
3. If stock is sufficient → Sale proceeds normally
4. If stock is low but sufficient → Sale proceeds with warning alert

### Stock Error Flow
1. User tries to sell more than available stock
2. API returns 400 with detailed stock error information
3. Frontend shows `StockWarningModal` with:
   - Clear error message showing shortage
   - "Cancel" button to go back and fix
   - "Force Save (Allow Overselling)" button to proceed anyway

### Force Save Flow
1. User clicks "Force Save" in the modal
2. Form resubmits with `bypassStockValidation: true`
3. API allows the sale despite insufficient stock
4. Sale proceeds normally with overselling allowed

## Business Benefits

### For Strict Inventory Control
- **Default behavior** prevents overselling
- **Clear error messages** guide users to update stock first
- **Maintains data integrity** by default

### For Flexible Business Operations
- **Force save option** allows overriding when needed
- **Emergency sales** can proceed when inventory updates are delayed
- **Business continuity** during system transitions

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix
- ❌ Generic error message
- ❌ No clear guidance for users
- ❌ Sales blocked without recourse
- ❌ Poor user feedback

### After Fix
- ✅ Clear stock shortage information
- ✅ Multiple options for users
- ✅ Professional error handling
- ✅ Business flexibility maintained

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Create a low-stock item:**
   ```javascript
   // Set an item's quantity to 0 or low value
   await Item.updateOne(
     { name: "dress", organization: "your-org-id" }, 
     { quantity: 0, lowStockThreshold: 10 }
   );
   ```

2. **Try to sell the item:**
   - Go to "Add Sales Voucher"
   - Select the low-stock item
   - Set quantity higher than available
   - Click "Save"

3. **Expected behavior:**
   - Stock warning modal appears
   - Shows shortage details
   - Offers "Force Save" option
   - Can proceed or cancel

## Configuration Options

### Allow Global Overselling
If your business always wants to allow overselling, modify the API default:

```javascript
// In sales-vouchers/route.js
const bypassStockValidation = salesOrderData.bypassStockValidation !== false; // Changed to default true
```

### Organization-Level Settings
You can extend this to check organization preferences:

```javascript
const orgSettings = await Organization.findById(organizationId);
const allowOverselling = orgSettings.allowOverselling || false;
const bypassStockValidation = salesOrderData.bypassStockValidation || allowOverselling;
```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `app/dashboard/sales/add-sales-voucher/page.jsx` - Main sales form
2. ✅ `app/api/organization/sales-vouchers/route.js` - Sales API with bypass
3. ✅ `components/StockWarningModal.jsx` - Enhanced modal component
4. ✅ `app/api/organization/check-stock/route.js` - New stock check API

## Conclusion

The fix maintains the integrity of your inventory system while providing the flexibility needed for real business operations. Users now get clear feedback about stock issues and can make informed decisions about how to proceed.
