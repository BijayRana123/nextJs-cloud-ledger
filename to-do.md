# To-Do List

## Current Issue: Unknown at rule @apply in CSS - FIXED ✅

The CSS file `components/ui/nepali-datepicker-styles.module.css` was using Tailwind's `@apply` directive, but it wasn't being properly processed, resulting in an "Unknown at rule @apply" error.

### Findings:
1. Tailwind CSS v4 is installed in the project (as a dev dependency)
2. PostCSS is configured with `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
3. The project is using Tailwind CSS v4 which has a different syntax for CSS modules
4. The globals.css file uses the new Tailwind v4 syntax with `@import "tailwindcss"` and `@theme inline`
5. No tailwind.config.js file was found

### Steps Taken:
1. ✅ Checked project configuration
2. ✅ Verified Tailwind installation
3. ✅ Fixed CSS syntax issues in the nepali-datepicker-styles.module.css file

### Solution Implemented:
Updated the CSS file to use standard CSS properties instead of the Tailwind `@apply` directive. This is compatible with Tailwind CSS v4 which no longer uses the `@apply` directive in the same way as previous versions.

The changes include:
- Replaced `@apply bg-white p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg` with direct CSS properties
- Replaced all other `@apply` directives with their equivalent CSS properties
- Maintained the same visual styling while ensuring compatibility with the current setup

This change ensures the CSS file will be properly processed without the "Unknown at rule @apply" error.

## New Task: Modernize Nepali Datepicker UI - COMPLETED ✅

The Nepali datepicker has been updated with a modern and visually appealing design.

### Steps Taken:
1. ✅ Enhanced the overall container with better styling
   - Added a larger border radius (1rem)
   - Improved shadow effect with deeper, more subtle shadows
   - Added hover effect to the entire calendar container
   - Set a max-width for better proportions

2. ✅ Improved the header design
   - Added a subtle border-bottom separator
   - Enhanced typography with better font weight and size
   - Improved navigation buttons with hover effects and transitions
   - Added more padding for better spacing

3. ✅ Updated the day cells with more modern styling
   - Created uniform sizing for day cells (2.5rem height/width)
   - Added flex centering for perfect alignment
   - Improved hover effects with subtle elevation (translateY)
   - Enhanced the selected day styling with a shadow effect

4. ✅ Added transitions and animations
   - Added transition effects to all interactive elements
   - Created a fade-in animation for the calendar appearance
   - Added subtle transform effects on hover states

5. ✅ Ensured design consistency
   - Used CSS variables for colors (--color-primary) to match the app theme
   - Used the system font stack with fallback to the app's sans-serif font
   - Maintained a clean, minimal aesthetic that works well with modern UIs

### Result:
The datepicker now has a modern, polished appearance with smooth interactions and a design that aligns with contemporary UI standards.

## New Task: Fix Combobox Dropdown Width - COMPLETED ✅

The combobox dropdown width needed to match the width of the input field.

### Issue:
The dropdown menu of the combobox component was not matching the width of the input field, causing a visual inconsistency in the UI.

### Initial Approach:
1. ✅ Added a React ref to measure the width of the trigger button
2. ✅ Implemented a state variable to store the measured width
3. ✅ Added an effect hook to calculate and update the width
4. ✅ Applied the width to the PopoverContent component using inline styles

### Improved Solution:
After reviewing the initial implementation, a more elegant solution was implemented:

1. ✅ Removed the manual width calculation using refs and useEffect
2. ✅ Utilized Radix UI's built-in CSS variable `--radix-popover-trigger-width`
3. ✅ Applied this variable directly in the className with `w-[var(--radix-popover-trigger-width)]`
4. ✅ Maintained the alignment to "start" for proper positioning
5. ✅ Kept the proper icon sizing (w-4)

### Benefits of the New Solution:
- More maintainable code with fewer lines
- No need for manual width calculations or event listeners
- Automatically handles resizing without additional JavaScript
- Uses the built-in functionality of Radix UI components
- More performant as it avoids unnecessary re-renders

The combobox dropdown now perfectly matches the width of the input field with a cleaner implementation.

## New Task: Fix Console Error with Combobox Keys - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
The console was showing an error: "Each child in a list should have a unique 'key' prop. Check the render method of Context.Provider."

### Root Cause:
The error was occurring in the Combobox component when mapping over the options array. There were potential issues with:
1. Missing key props
2. Duplicate key values
3. Handling of undefined or null values in the options array

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Added a check to ensure options is an array before mapping over it
2. ✅ Improved the key generation to handle cases where option.value might be undefined or null
3. ✅ Added a fallback key using Math.random() to ensure uniqueness in all cases

### Benefits:
- Eliminated the React warning about missing/duplicate keys
- Made the component more robust against different types of input data
- Improved error handling for edge cases
- Enhanced overall component stability

The combobox now properly handles all options data without generating console errors.

## New Task: Fix New Supplier Not Showing in Combobox - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
When a new supplier was added through the modal, it was saved to the database but not appearing in the supplier combobox field.

### Root Cause:
There was a mismatch between the data structure being passed from the modal to the parent component:
1. The modal was passing a simplified object with just value and label properties
2. The parent component was expecting the full supplier object with _id and name properties
3. The ID field naming was inconsistent (sometimes _id, sometimes code)

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Modified the supplier modal to pass the complete supplier object returned from the API
2. ✅ Updated the parent component to handle different possible ID field names (_id, id, or code)
3. ✅ Added better logging to track the data flow
4. ✅ Improved the supplier option creation with proper formatting
5. ✅ Added code to update the selected supplier details immediately
6. ✅ Increased the timeout duration to ensure state updates are processed

### Benefits:
- New suppliers now appear immediately in the dropdown after creation
- The newly created supplier is automatically selected
- The supplier details section is updated with the new supplier's information
- The solution is more robust against variations in the API response format
- Better debugging information is available through console logs

The user can now seamlessly add new suppliers and continue their workflow without interruption.
