# To-Do List

## Current Issue: Unknown at rule @apply in CSS - FIXED ✅

The CSS file `components/ui/nepali-datepicker-styles.module.css` was using Tailwind's `@apply` directive, but it wasn't being properly processed, resulting in an "Unknown at rule @apply" error.

### Findings:
1. Tailwind CSS v4 is installed in the project (as a dev dependency)
2. PostCSS is configured with `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
3. The project is using Tailwind CSS v4 which has a different syntax for CSS modules
4. The globals.css file uses the new Tailwind v4 syntax with `@import "tailwindcss"` and `@theme inline`
5. No tailwind.config.js file was found

### Steps Taken:
1. ✅ Checked project configuration
2. ✅ Verified Tailwind installation
3. ✅ Fixed CSS syntax issues in the nepali-datepicker-styles.module.css file

### Solution Implemented:
Updated the CSS file to use standard CSS properties instead of the Tailwind `@apply` directive. This is compatible with Tailwind CSS v4 which no longer uses the `@apply` directive in the same way as previous versions.

The changes include:
- Replaced `@apply bg-white p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg` with direct CSS properties
- Replaced all other `@apply` directives with their equivalent CSS properties
- Maintained the same visual styling while ensuring compatibility with the current setup

This change ensures the CSS file will be properly processed without the "Unknown at rule @apply" error.

## New Task: Modernize Nepali Datepicker UI - COMPLETED ✅

The Nepali datepicker has been updated with a modern and visually appealing design.

### Steps Taken:
1. ✅ Enhanced the overall container with better styling
   - Added a larger border radius (1rem)
   - Improved shadow effect with deeper, more subtle shadows
   - Added hover effect to the entire calendar container
   - Set a max-width for better proportions

2. ✅ Improved the header design
   - Added a subtle border-bottom separator
   - Enhanced typography with better font weight and size
   - Improved navigation buttons with hover effects and transitions
   - Added more padding for better spacing

3. ✅ Updated the day cells with more modern styling
   - Created uniform sizing for day cells (2.5rem height/width)
   - Added flex centering for perfect alignment
   - Improved hover effects with subtle elevation (translateY)
   - Enhanced the selected day styling with a shadow effect

4. ✅ Added transitions and animations
   - Added transition effects to all interactive elements
   - Created a fade-in animation for the calendar appearance
   - Added subtle transform effects on hover states

5. ✅ Ensured design consistency
   - Used CSS variables for colors (--color-primary) to match the app theme
   - Used the system font stack with fallback to the app's sans-serif font
   - Maintained a clean, minimal aesthetic that works well with modern UIs

### Result:
The datepicker now has a modern, polished appearance with smooth interactions and a design that aligns with contemporary UI standards.

## New Task: Fix Combobox Dropdown Width - COMPLETED ✅

The combobox dropdown width needed to match the width of the input field.

### Issue:
The dropdown menu of the combobox component was not matching the width of the input field, causing a visual inconsistency in the UI.

### Initial Approach:
1. ✅ Added a React ref to measure the width of the trigger button
2. ✅ Implemented a state variable to store the measured width
3. ✅ Added an effect hook to calculate and update the width
4. ✅ Applied the width to the PopoverContent component using inline styles

### Improved Solution:
After reviewing the initial implementation, a more elegant solution was implemented:

1. ✅ Removed the manual width calculation using refs and useEffect
2. ✅ Utilized Radix UI's built-in CSS variable `--radix-popover-trigger-width`
3. ✅ Applied this variable directly in the className with `w-[var(--radix-popover-trigger-width)]`
4. ✅ Maintained the alignment to "start" for proper positioning
5. ✅ Kept the proper icon sizing (w-4)

### Benefits of the New Solution:
- More maintainable code with fewer lines
- No need for manual width calculations or event listeners
- Automatically handles resizing without additional JavaScript
- Uses the built-in functionality of Radix UI components
- More performant as it avoids unnecessary re-renders

The combobox dropdown now perfectly matches the width of the input field with a cleaner implementation.

## New Task: Fix Console Error with Combobox Keys - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
The console was showing an error: "Each child in a list should have a unique 'key' prop. Check the render method of Context.Provider."

### Root Cause:
The error was occurring in the Combobox component when mapping over the options array. There were potential issues with:
1. Missing key props
2. Duplicate key values
3. Handling of undefined or null values in the options array

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Added a check to ensure options is an array before mapping over it
2. ✅ Improved the key generation to handle cases where option.value might be undefined or null
3. ✅ Added a fallback key using Math.random() to ensure uniqueness in all cases

### Benefits:
- Eliminated the React warning about missing/duplicate keys
- Made the component more robust against different types of input data
- Improved error handling for edge cases
- Enhanced overall component stability

The combobox now properly handles all options data without generating console errors.

## New Task: Fix New Supplier Not Showing in Combobox - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
When a new supplier was added through the modal, it was saved to the database but not appearing in the supplier combobox field.

### Root Cause:
There was a mismatch between the data structure being passed from the modal to the parent component:
1. The modal was passing a simplified object with just value and label properties
2. The parent component was expecting the full supplier object with _id and name properties
3. The ID field naming was inconsistent (sometimes _id, sometimes code)

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Modified the supplier modal to pass the complete supplier object returned from the API
2. ✅ Updated the parent component to handle different possible ID field names (_id, id, or code)
3. ✅ Added better logging to track the data flow
4. ✅ Improved the supplier option creation with proper formatting
5. ✅ Added code to update the selected supplier details immediately
6. ✅ Increased the timeout duration to ensure state updates are processed

### Benefits:
- New suppliers now appear immediately in the dropdown after creation
- The newly created supplier is automatically selected
- The supplier details section is updated with the new supplier's information
- The solution is more robust against variations in the API response format
- Better debugging information is available through console logs

The user can now seamlessly add new suppliers and continue their workflow without interruption.

## New Task: Fix API Route Error with Dynamic Params - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
The terminal was showing an error: "Route '/api/organization/suppliers/[id]' used `params.id`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties."

### Root Cause:
In Next.js App Router, the `params` object in API routes needs to be awaited before accessing its properties. This is because dynamic route parameters are resolved asynchronously.

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Modified the API route handler to properly await the context.params object
2. ✅ Changed the function signature to use context instead of destructuring params directly
3. ✅ Added explicit awaiting of the params object before accessing the id property
4. ✅ Added additional logging for better debugging
5. ✅ Improved the overall structure of the API route handler

### Benefits:
- Eliminated the Next.js warning about synchronous access to params
- Made the API route more robust and compliant with Next.js best practices
- Improved error handling and debugging capabilities
- Enhanced overall API route stability
- Better aligned with Next.js App Router architecture

The API route now correctly handles dynamic parameters in an asynchronous manner, following Next.js best practices.

## New Task: Show Supplier Name with Address in Combobox - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
The combobox was only showing the supplier name, but needed to display both the supplier name and address from the database.

### Root Cause:
1. The supplier options were being formatted with only the name field
2. There was no code to fetch all suppliers when the component mounted
3. The address field was available in the supplier data but not being used in the label

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Added a useEffect hook to fetch all suppliers when the component mounts
2. ✅ Modified the supplier options format to include both name and address:
   ```javascript
   {
     value: supplier._id,
     label: supplier.name + (supplier.address ? ` - ${supplier.address}` : ''),
     supplierData: supplier // Store the full supplier object
   }
   ```
3. ✅ Updated the onSupplierCreated handler to also include the address in the label
4. ✅ Added loading state to handle the asynchronous data fetching
5. ✅ Stored the full supplier object in the options for easier access

### Benefits:
- Users can now see both the supplier name and address in the dropdown
- Improved user experience with more context about each supplier
- Better data organization with the full supplier object stored in the options
- Consistent formatting between existing suppliers and newly created ones
- More informative UI that helps users make better selections

The combobox now displays supplier information in a more comprehensive format, making it easier for users to identify and select the correct supplier.

## New Task: Enhance Combobox Search and Display - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
The combobox search functionality needed improvements to be case-insensitive, limit displayed suppliers to 4 maximum, and ensure the "Add New" option is always shown. Additionally, there was an inconsistency in the API URL for creating new suppliers.

### Root Cause:
1. The search functionality was using default case-sensitive matching
2. There was no limit on the number of suppliers displayed in the dropdown
3. The API endpoint for creating suppliers was inconsistent with the API structure
4. The Command component's built-in filtering was interfering with our custom filtering

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Made the search functionality case-insensitive:
   ```javascript
   const filteredOptions = React.useMemo(() => {
     if (!inputValue) return options;
     return options.filter(option => 
       option.label.toLowerCase().includes(inputValue.toLowerCase())
     );
   }, [options, inputValue]);
   ```

2. ✅ Limited displayed suppliers to maximum 4:
   ```javascript
   const displayedOptions = React.useMemo(() => {
     return filteredOptions.slice(0, 4);
   }, [filteredOptions]);
   ```

3. ✅ Ensured "Add New" option is always shown after the suppliers
   - Kept the "Add New" option outside the filtered options mapping

4. ✅ Fixed the API URL inconsistency:
   - Changed the supplier creation endpoint from `/api/organization/create` to `/api/organization/suppliers`
   - Added a POST method to the suppliers API route to handle supplier creation

5. ✅ Disabled the Command component's built-in filtering:
   ```javascript
   <Command className="w-full" shouldFilter={false}>
   ```

6. ✅ Added better handling of empty search results:
   ```javascript
   {displayedOptions.length === 0 && inputValue !== "" ? (
     <CommandEmpty>No item found.</CommandEmpty>
   ) : (
     <CommandGroup>
       {/* Options and Add New button */}
     </CommandGroup>
   )}
   ```

7. ✅ Added debugging logs to help troubleshoot filtering issues

### Benefits:
- More intuitive search experience that matches user expectations
- Cleaner dropdown UI with limited number of options
- Consistent API structure following RESTful conventions
- Better user experience with the "Add New" option always available
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Fixed search functionality to properly filter options based on user input

The combobox now provides a more refined user experience with properly functioning search capabilities and a cleaner interface.
