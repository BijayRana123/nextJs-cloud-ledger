# To-Do List

## Current Issue: Unknown at rule @apply in CSS - FIXED ✅

The CSS file `components/ui/nepali-datepicker-styles.module.css` was using Tailwind's `@apply` directive, but it wasn't being properly processed, resulting in an "Unknown at rule @apply" error.

### Findings:
1. Tailwind CSS v4 is installed in the project (as a dev dependency)
2. PostCSS is configured with `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
3. The project is using Tailwind CSS v4 which has a different syntax for CSS modules
4. The globals.css file uses the new Tailwind v4 syntax with `@import "tailwindcss"` and `@theme inline`
5. No tailwind.config.js file was found

### Steps Taken:
1. ✅ Checked project configuration
2. ✅ Verified Tailwind installation
3. ✅ Fixed CSS syntax issues in the nepali-datepicker-styles.module.css file

### Solution Implemented:
Updated the CSS file to use standard CSS properties instead of the Tailwind `@apply` directive. This is compatible with Tailwind CSS v4 which no longer uses the `@apply` directive in the same way as previous versions.

The changes include:
- Replaced `@apply bg-white p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg` with direct CSS properties
- Replaced all other `@apply` directives with their equivalent CSS properties
- Maintained the same visual styling while ensuring compatibility with the current setup

This change ensures the CSS file will be properly processed without the "Unknown at rule @apply" error.

## New Task: Modernize Nepali Datepicker UI - COMPLETED ✅

The Nepali datepicker has been updated with a modern and visually appealing design.

### Steps Taken:
1. ✅ Enhanced the overall container with better styling
   - Added a larger border radius (1rem)
   - Improved shadow effect with deeper, more subtle shadows
   - Added hover effect to the entire calendar container
   - Set a max-width for better proportions

2. ✅ Improved the header design
   - Added a subtle border-bottom separator
   - Enhanced typography with better font weight and size
   - Improved navigation buttons with hover effects and transitions
   - Added more padding for better spacing

3. ✅ Updated the day cells with more modern styling
   - Created uniform sizing for day cells (2.5rem height/width)
   - Added flex centering for perfect alignment
   - Improved hover effects with subtle elevation (translateY)
   - Enhanced the selected day styling with a shadow effect

4. ✅ Added transitions and animations
   - Added transition effects to all interactive elements
   - Created a fade-in animation for the calendar appearance

5. ✅ Ensured design consistency
   - Used CSS variables for colors (--color-primary) to match the app theme
   - Used the system font stack with fallback to the app's sans-serif font
   - Maintained a clean, minimal aesthetic that works well with modern UIs

### Result:
The datepicker now has a modern, polished appearance with smooth interactions and a design that aligns with contemporary UI standards.

## New Task: Fix Combobox Dropdown Width - COMPLETED ✅

The combobox dropdown width needed to match the width of the input field.

### Issue:
The dropdown menu of the combobox component was not matching the width of the input field, causing a visual inconsistency in the UI.

### Steps Taken:
1. ✅ Added a React ref to measure the width of the trigger button
2. ✅ Implemented a state variable to store the measured width
3. ✅ Added an effect hook to:
   - Calculate the width when the component mounts
   - Update the width when the window resizes
   - Clean up the event listener when the component unmounts
4. ✅ Applied the exact width to the PopoverContent component using inline styles
5. ✅ Set the alignment to "start" to ensure proper positioning
6. ✅ Fixed icon sizing issues (changed w-full to w-4 for the icons)

### Solution Implemented:
The combobox dropdown now dynamically matches the exact width of the input field, creating a more polished and consistent UI experience. The solution is responsive and will maintain the correct width even if the window is resized.
