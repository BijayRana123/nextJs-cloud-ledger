# To-Do List

## New Task: Fix Authentication Token Retrieval in Forms - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
The PaySupplierForm and ReceivePaymentForm components were failing to retrieve the authentication token from cookies, resulting in 401 Unauthorized errors when trying to fetch suppliers and customers data.

Error messages:
```
PaySupplierForm: Token from cookie: undefined
XHRGEThttp://localhost:3000/api/organization/suppliers[HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized 1430ms]
Failed to fetch suppliers: 401

ReceivePaymentForm: Token from cookie: undefined
XHRGEThttp://localhost:3000/api/organization/customers[HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized 272ms]
Failed to fetch customers: 401
```

### Root Cause:
The components were trying to retrieve the token from the `sb-mnvxxmmrlvjgpnhditxc-auth-token-array` cookie using `Cookies.get()`, but the token was stored in a JSON array format that wasn't being properly parsed. Additionally, the login route was setting two different cookies:
1. `sb-mnvxxmmrlvjgpnhditxc-auth-token` (direct token)
2. `sb-mnvxxmmrlvjgpnhditxc-auth-token-array` (array format for backward compatibility)

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Created a utility function to handle token retrieval from both cookie formats:
   ```javascript
   // lib/utils/auth-helpers.js
   export function getAuthToken() {
     // Try to get the token from the direct cookie first
     let token = Cookies.get('sb-mnvxxmmrlvjgpnhditxc-auth-token');
     
     // If not found, try the array format cookie
     if (!token) {
       const arrayToken = Cookies.get('sb-mnvxxmmrlvjgpnhditxc-auth-token-array');
       if (arrayToken) {
         try {
           // Parse the JSON array and get the first element
           const tokenArray = JSON.parse(arrayToken);
           if (Array.isArray(tokenArray) && tokenArray.length > 0) {
             token = tokenArray[0];
           }
         } catch (e) {
           console.error("Error parsing token array:", e);
         }
       }
     }
     
     return token || null;
   }
   ```

2. ✅ Created a helper function to generate headers with the authentication token:
   ```javascript
   export function getAuthHeaders(additionalHeaders = {}) {
     const token = getAuthToken();
     
     return {
       'Authorization': token ? `Bearer ${token}` : '',
       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       ...additionalHeaders
     };
   }
   ```

3. ✅ Updated both PaySupplierForm and ReceivePaymentForm components to use these helper functions:
   ```javascript
   import { getAuthToken, getAuthHeaders } from '@/lib/utils/auth-helpers';
   
   // In useEffect for fetching data
   const response = await fetch(`/api/organization/suppliers`, {
     headers: getAuthHeaders(),
   });
   
   // In handleSubmit for submitting form data
   const response = await fetch('/api/organization/transactions/pay-supplier', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: getAuthHeaders(),
     body: JSON.stringify(dataToSend),
   });
   ```

### Benefits:
- Fixed the 401 Unauthorized errors when fetching suppliers and customers
- Improved code maintainability by centralizing token retrieval logic
- Added support for both cookie formats (direct token and array format)
- Reduced code duplication across components
- Made the authentication process more robust against different token storage formats
- Ensured consistent authorization header usage across all API requests

## Task: Fix Organization Data Access Control - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
If a user creates more than one organization, that user can currently access data from all their organizations regardless of which organization they are currently working with. This is a security issue as users should only be able to access data from their currently selected organization.

### Root Cause:
The API routes were always using the first organization from the user's organizations array (`user.organizations[0]._id`), regardless of which organization the user was currently working with. The auth middleware was not properly enforcing organization access control.

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Updated the auth middleware to verify that the user belongs to the organization specified in the JWT token:
   ```javascript
   // Verify that the user belongs to this organization
   if (organizationId && user) {
     const hasAccess = user.organizations.some(org => org.toString() === organizationId.toString());
     if (!hasAccess) {
       return NextResponse.json({ 
         message: 'You do not have access to this organization', 
         details: 'Access denied to the requested organization' 
       }, { status: 403 });
     }
   }
   ```

2. ✅ Modified API routes to use the organization ID from the JWT token instead of always using the first organization:
   ```javascript
   // Get the organization ID from the request object (set by the auth middleware)
   const organizationId = request.organizationId;

   // Check if organizationId was found
   if (!organizationId) {
     return NextResponse.json({ message: 'No organization context found. Please select an organization.' }, { status: 400 });
   }
   ```

3. ✅ Fixed the login process to ensure the JWT token includes the correct organization ID:
   ```javascript
   // If user has organizations, include the first one as the default
   const defaultOrganizationId = user.organizations && user.organizations.length > 0 
     ? user.organizations[0]._id 
     : null;
   
   const payload = {
     user: {
       id: user._id,
       organizationId: defaultOrganizationId, // Include default organization ID
     },
   };
   ```

4. ✅ Updated the organization switching functionality to properly set the organization ID in the JWT token and update the cookie:
   ```javascript
   // Generate a new JWT with the updated organization ID
   const payload = {
     user: {
       id: user._id,
       organizationId: newOrganizationId, // Use the new organization ID
     },
   };

   const token = jwt.sign(payload, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '1h' });
   
   // Set the token as a cookie that can be accessed by JavaScript
   const cookieValue = JSON.stringify([token]);
   response.cookies.set('sb-mnvxxmmrlvjgpnhditxc-auth-token', cookieValue, cookieOptions);
   ```

### Benefits:
- Improved security by ensuring users can only access data from their currently selected organization
- Better organization isolation, preventing data leakage between organizations
- Proper enforcement of organization access control in the auth middleware
- Consistent organization context across all API routes
- Seamless organization switching with proper token and cookie updates

### Additional Fix:
After initial implementation, we encountered an "Authentication failed: Invalid token" error. This was caused by inconsistent JWT secret handling across different parts of the application. We fixed this by:

1. ✅ Ensuring all JWT operations (signing and verification) use the same secret value:
   ```javascript
   // Ensure JWT_SECRET is a string and not undefined
   const jwtSecret = process.env.JWT_SECRET || 'fallback_secret';
   console.log('Using JWT_SECRET:', jwtSecret);
   
   // Use the consistent secret for token operations
   const token = jwt.sign(payload, jwtSecret, { expiresIn: '1h' });
   // OR
   const decoded = jwt.verify(token, jwtSecret);
   ```

2. ✅ Applied this consistent approach in:
   - Login route (app/api/auth/login/route.js)
   - Auth middleware (lib/middleware/auth.js)
   - Organization switching route (app/api/user/switch-organization/route.js)

This ensures that tokens signed in one part of the application can be successfully verified in other parts, maintaining a consistent authentication flow.

## Current Issue: Unknown at rule @apply in CSS - FIXED ✅

The CSS file `components/ui/nepali-datepicker-styles.module.css` was using Tailwind's `@apply` directive, but it wasn't being properly processed, resulting in an "Unknown at rule @apply" error.

### Findings:
1. Tailwind CSS v4 is installed in the project (as a dev dependency)
2. PostCSS is configured with `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
3. The project is using Tailwind CSS v4 which has a different syntax for CSS modules
4. The globals.css file uses the new Tailwind v4 syntax with `@import "tailwindcss"` and `@theme inline`
5. No tailwind.config.js file was found

### Steps Taken:
1. ✅ Checked project configuration
2. ✅ Verified Tailwind installation
3. ✅ Fixed CSS syntax issues in the nepali-datepicker-styles.module.css file

### Solution Implemented:
Updated the CSS file to use standard CSS properties instead of the Tailwind `@apply` directive. This is compatible with Tailwind CSS v4 which no longer uses the `@apply` directive in the same way as previous versions.

The changes include:
- Replaced `@apply bg-white p-4 rounded-md shadow-lg` with direct CSS properties
- Replaced all other `@apply` directives with their equivalent CSS properties
- Maintained the same visual styling while ensuring compatibility with the current setup

This change ensures the CSS file will be properly processed without the "Unknown at rule @apply" error.

## New Task: Modernize Nepali Datepicker UI - COMPLETED ✅

The Nepali datepicker has been updated with a modern and visually appealing design.

### Steps Taken:
1. ✅ Enhanced the overall container with better styling
   - Added a larger border radius (1rem)
   - Improved shadow effect with deeper, more subtle shadows
   - Added hover effect to the entire calendar container
   - Set a max-width for better proportions

2. ✅ Improved the header design
   - Added a subtle border-bottom separator
   - Enhanced typography with better font weight and size
   - Improved navigation buttons with hover effects and transitions
   - Added more padding for better spacing

3. ✅ Updated the day cells with more modern styling
   - Created uniform sizing for day cells (2.5rem height/width)
   - Added flex centering for perfect alignment
   - Improved hover effects with subtle elevation (translateY)
   - Enhanced the selected day styling with a shadow effect

4. ✅ Added transitions and animations
   - Added transition effects to all interactive elements
   - Created a fade-in animation for the calendar appearance
   - Added subtle transform effects on hover states

5. ✅ Ensured design consistency
   - Used CSS variables for colors (--color-primary) to match the app theme
   - Used the system font stack with fallback to the app's sans-serif font
   - Maintained a clean, minimal aesthetic that works well with modern UIs

### Result:
The datepicker now has a modern, polished appearance with smooth interactions and a design that aligns with contemporary UI standards.

## New Task: Fix Combobox Dropdown Width - COMPLETED ✅

The combobox dropdown width needed to match the width of the input field.

### Issue:
The dropdown menu of the combobox component was not matching the width of the input field, causing a visual inconsistency in the UI.

### Initial Approach:
1. ✅ Added a React ref to measure the width of the trigger button
2. ✅ Implemented a state variable to store the measured width
3. ✅ Added an effect hook to calculate and update the width
4. ✅ Applied the width to the PopoverContent component using inline styles

### Improved Solution:
After reviewing the initial implementation, a more elegant solution was implemented:

1. ✅ Removed the manual width calculation using refs and useEffect
2. ✅ Utilized Radix UI's built-in CSS variable `--radix-popover-trigger-width`
3. ✅ Applied this variable directly in the className with `w-[var(--radix-popover-trigger-width)]`
4. ✅ Maintained the alignment to "start" for proper positioning
5. ✅ Kept the proper icon sizing (w-4)

### Benefits of the New Solution:
- More maintainable code with fewer lines
- No need for manual width calculations or event listeners
- Automatically handles resizing without additional JavaScript
- Uses the built-in functionality of Radix UI components
- More performant as it avoids unnecessary re-renders

The combobox dropdown now perfectly matches the width of the input field with a cleaner implementation.

## New Task: Fix Console Error with Combobox Keys - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
The console was showing an error: "Each child in a list should have a unique 'key' prop. Check the render method of Context.Provider."

### Root Cause:
The error was occurring in the Combobox component when mapping over the options array. There were potential issues with:
1. Missing key props
2. Duplicate key values
3. Handling of undefined or null values in the options array

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Added a check to ensure options is an array before mapping over it
2. ✅ Improved the key generation to handle cases where option.value might be undefined or null
3. ✅ Added a fallback key using Math.random() to ensure uniqueness in all cases

### Benefits:
- Eliminated the React warning about missing/duplicate keys
- Made the component more robust against different types of input data
- Improved error handling for edge cases
- Enhanced overall component stability

The combobox now properly handles all options data without generating console errors.

## New Task: Fix New Supplier Not Showing in Combobox - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
When a new supplier was added through the modal, it was saved to the database but not appearing in the supplier combobox field.

### Root Cause:
There was a mismatch between the data structure being passed from the modal to the parent component:
1. The modal was passing a simplified object with just value and label properties
2. The parent component was expecting the full supplier object with _id and name properties
3. The ID field naming was inconsistent (sometimes _id, sometimes code)

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Modified the supplier modal to pass the complete supplier object returned from the API
2. ✅ Updated the parent component to handle different possible ID field names (_id, id, or code)
3. ✅ Added better logging to track the data flow
4. ✅ Improved the supplier option creation with proper formatting
5. ✅ Added code to update the selected supplier details immediately
6. ✅ Increased the timeout duration to ensure state updates are processed

### Benefits:
- New suppliers now appear immediately in the dropdown after creation
- The newly created supplier is automatically selected
- The supplier details section is updated with the new supplier's information
- The solution is more robust against variations in the API response format
- Better debugging information is available through console logs

The user can now seamlessly add new suppliers and continue their workflow without interruption.

## New Task: Fix API Route Error with Dynamic Params - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
The terminal was showing an error: "Route '/api/organization/suppliers/[id]' used `params.id`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties."

### Root Cause:
In Next.js App Router, the `params` object in API routes needs to be awaited before accessing its properties. This is because dynamic route parameters are resolved asynchronously.

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Modified the API route handler to properly await the context.params object
2. ✅ Changed the function signature to use context instead of destructuring params directly
3. ✅ Added explicit awaiting of the params object before accessing the id property
4. ✅ Added additional logging for better debugging
5. ✅ Improved the overall structure of the API route handler

### Benefits:
- Eliminated the Next.js warning about synchronous access to params
- Made the API route more robust and compliant with Next.js best practices
- Improved error handling and debugging capabilities
- Enhanced overall API route stability
- Better aligned with Next.js App Router architecture

The API route now correctly handles dynamic parameters in an asynchronous manner, following Next.js best practices.

## New Task: Show Supplier Name with Address in Combobox - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
The combobox was only showing the supplier name, but needed to display both the supplier name and address from the database.

### Root Cause:
1. The supplier options were being formatted with only the name field
2. There was no code to fetch all suppliers when the component mounted
3. The address field was available in the supplier data but not being used in the label

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Added a useEffect hook to fetch all suppliers when the component mounts
2. ✅ Modified the supplier options format to include both name and address:
   ```javascript
   {
     value: supplier._id,
     label: supplier.name + (supplier.address ? ` - ${supplier.address}` : ''),
     supplierData: supplier // Store the full supplier object
   }
   ```
3. ✅ Updated the onSupplierCreated handler to also include the address in the label
4. ✅ Added loading state to handle the asynchronous data fetching
5. ✅ Stored the full supplier object in the options for easier access

### Benefits:
- Users can now see both the supplier name and address in the dropdown
- Improved user experience with more context about each supplier
- Better data organization with the full supplier object stored in the options
- Consistent formatting between existing suppliers and newly created ones
- More informative UI that helps users make better selections

The combobox now displays supplier information in a more comprehensive format, making it easier for users to identify and select the correct supplier.

## New Task: Enhance Combobox Search and Display - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
The combobox search functionality needed improvements to be case-insensitive, limit displayed suppliers to 4 maximum, and ensure the "Add New" option is always shown. Additionally, there was an inconsistency in the API URL for creating new suppliers.

### Root Cause:
1. The search functionality was using default case-sensitive matching
2. There was no limit on the number of suppliers displayed in the dropdown
3. The API endpoint for creating suppliers was inconsistent with the API structure
4. The Command component's built-in filtering was interfering with our custom filtering

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Made the search functionality case-insensitive:
   ```javascript
   const filteredOptions = React.useMemo(() => {
     if (!inputValue) return options;
     return options.filter(option => 
       option.label.toLowerCase().includes(inputValue.toLowerCase())
     );
   }, [options, inputValue]);
   ```

2. ✅ Limited displayed suppliers to maximum 4:
   ```javascript
   const displayedOptions = React.useMemo(() => {
     return filteredOptions.slice(0, 4);
   }, [filteredOptions]);
   ```

3. ✅ Ensured "Add New" option is always shown after the suppliers
   - Kept the "Add New" option outside the filtered options mapping

4. ✅ Fixed the API URL inconsistency:
   - Changed the supplier creation endpoint from `/api/organization/create` to `/api/organization/suppliers`
   - Added a POST method to the suppliers API route to handle supplier creation

5. ✅ Disabled the Command component's built-in filtering:
   ```javascript
   <Command className="w-full" shouldFilter={false}>
   ```

6. ✅ Added better handling of empty search results:
   ```javascript
   {displayedOptions.length === 0 && inputValue !== "" ? (
     <CommandEmpty>No item found.</CommandEmpty>
   ) : (
     <CommandGroup>
       {/* Options and Add New button */}
     </CommandGroup>
   )}
   ```

7. ✅ Added debugging logs to help troubleshoot filtering issues

### Benefits:
- More intuitive search experience that matches user expectations
- Cleaner dropdown UI with limited number of options
- Consistent API structure following RESTful conventions
- Better user experience with the "Add New" option always available
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Fixed search functionality to properly filter options based on user input

The combobox now provides a more refined user experience with properly functioning search capabilities and a cleaner interface.

## New Task: Fix Authentication Token Not Found Error - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
The console was showing an error: "Authentication token not found" in the supplier-section.jsx component. After fixing the cookie access issue, we're now seeing a new error: "Auth middleware error: Error [JsonWebTokenError]: invalid token" when making API requests.

### Root Cause:
There are three issues:

1. **Cookie Access Issue**: The `getCookie` function was not finding the cookie named `sb-mnvxxmmrlvjgpnhditxc-auth-token`. After investigation, we discovered that the cookie was being set as HTTP-only in the login API route, which means JavaScript cannot access it. Additionally, the client-side login page was attempting to set the same cookie using js-cookie, creating a conflict.

2. **URL Encoding Issue**: The cookie value was URL-encoded (with characters like `%5B` for `[` and `%22` for `"`), but we were not decoding it before using it in the Authorization header. This caused the server to receive a malformed token that couldn't be verified.

3. **JWT Verification Issue**: After fixing the cookie access issue, we encountered a JWT verification error: "Auth middleware error: Error [JsonWebTokenError]: invalid token". This was because the server was receiving the encoded token string instead of the actual JWT.

### Solution Implemented:
#### Part 1: Cookie Access Issue
1. ✅ Fixed the login API route to set a non-HTTP-only cookie:
   - Changed `httpOnly: true` to `httpOnly: false` to allow JavaScript access
   - Updated `sameSite` from 'strict' to 'lax' to improve compatibility
   - Maintained other security settings like path and secure flags

2. ✅ Simplified the login page cookie handling:
   - Removed redundant client-side cookie setting with js-cookie
   - Added better logging to verify the server-set cookie
   - Maintained the return URL functionality for better user experience

3. ✅ Streamlined the `getCookie` function:
   - Simplified the cookie parsing logic to focus on the expected format
   - Maintained comprehensive logging for debugging
   - Kept the user-friendly error messages and redirection

4. ✅ Enhanced redirection to login page:
   - Added return URL parameter to redirect back after successful login
   - Added confirmation alert to inform users about the redirection

#### Part 2: URL Encoding and JWT Verification Issues
5. ✅ Added detailed token debugging:
   - Enhanced logging in the auth middleware to show token format and JWT_SECRET
   - Added token structure validation in the login page
   - Implemented payload decoding and inspection in supplier-section.jsx
   - Added comprehensive error reporting for token verification issues

6. ✅ Enhanced JWT token handling:
   - Added safeguards to ensure JWT_SECRET is always a string
   - Improved token generation logging in the login API
   - Added token format validation and debugging
   - Enhanced error handling for token verification failures
   - Added detailed logging of the Authorization header

7. ✅ Improved API error handling:
   - Added better error reporting for failed API requests
   - Enhanced logging of error responses
   - Added specific handling for 401 authorization errors
   - Improved the debugging information available for troubleshooting

8. ✅ Fixed URL encoding issue:
   - Updated the `getCookie` function to properly decode URL-encoded cookie values
   - Added fallback mechanisms to extract JWT tokens from various string formats
   - Implemented better error handling for JSON parsing failures
   - Added detailed logging of both raw and decoded cookie values

### Benefits:
- More robust cookie handling that can adapt to different Supabase cookie formats
- Better user experience with clear error messages and smooth redirection
- Improved debugging capabilities with comprehensive logging
- More resilient authentication flow that can handle edge cases
- Better security by ensuring proper authentication before accessing protected resources

The application now properly handles authentication token retrieval and provides clear guidance to users when they need to log in.

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Fixed Cookie Accessibility**: Changed the cookie from HTTP-only to non-HTTP-only in the login API route to allow JavaScript access.
2. **Eliminated Redundant Cookie Setting**: Removed duplicate cookie setting in the login page to avoid conflicts.
3. **Streamlined Cookie Parsing**: Simplified the `getCookie` function to focus on the expected format while maintaining robust error handling.
4. **Improved User Experience**: Enhanced error messages and added user-friendly alerts when authentication is required.
5. **Added Return URL Functionality**: Implemented a returnUrl parameter to redirect users back to their original page after successful login.
6. **Enhanced JWT Token Handling**: Added safeguards for JWT_SECRET, improved token generation and validation, and added detailed logging.
7. **Improved Error Handling**: Added specific error messages for different JWT verification failures and enhanced API error reporting.
8. **Added Comprehensive Debugging**: Implemented detailed logging throughout the authentication flow to help diagnose issues.
9. **Fixed URL Encoding Issue**: Updated the `getCookie` function to properly decode URL-encoded cookie values before using them in the Authorization header.

These changes ensure that the authentication token is properly set by the server, can be accessed by client-side JavaScript, is correctly decoded from URL encoding, and is properly verified by the server-side middleware, resolving both the "Authentication token not found" error and the "invalid token" verification error.

## New Task: Fix Hydration Error in Purchase Order Detail Page - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
The application is showing a hydration error in the Purchase Order Detail page:
```
In HTML, whitespace text nodes cannot be a child of <tr>. Make sure you don't have any extra whitespace between tags on each line of your source code.
```

The error occurs in the `PurchaseOrderDetailPage` component, specifically in the table structure where there appears to be whitespace issues with the `<tr>` elements.

### Root Cause:
After examining the code, we identified that the issue is in the `CustomTableRow` component usage in the `PurchaseOrderDetailPage`. The error message shows:
```
> <tr > className={"border-b transition-colors hover:bg-muted/50 data-[state=selected]:bg-muted "} > > <CustomTableCell>
```

This indicates that there's a whitespace issue in the rendered HTML, where the `className` attribute appears to be outside the JSX tag, causing a mismatch between server and client rendering.

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Examined the `CustomTableRow` component implementation
2. ✅ Checked how it's being used in the `PurchaseOrderDetailPage`
3. ✅ Initially tried to fix whitespace issues in the table components:
   - Added explicit trimming of the className string with `.trim()`
   - Simplified the JSX structure to minimize whitespace
   - Removed unnecessary line breaks that could introduce whitespace
   - Replaced JSX syntax with `React.createElement` for the components
4. ✅ After continued issues, tried a direct HTML approach:
   - Replaced custom table components with standard HTML elements
   - Used direct `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements
5. ✅ Finally, restored the original CustomTable components:
   - Reverted back to the original JSX implementation
   - Removed the React.createElement approach that was causing nested elements
   - Ensured proper component structure to avoid hydration errors

The issue was that our attempts to fix the whitespace problems with React.createElement were actually creating nested HTML elements (like `<thead>` containing `<th>` directly, which is invalid). The error messages showed that elements like `<th>` cannot be a child of `<thead>` and `<td>` cannot be a child of `<tbody>`.

By reverting to the original JSX implementation of the CustomTable components, we've ensured that the proper HTML structure is maintained, with `<tr>` elements as children of `<thead>` and `<tbody>`, and `<th>` and `<td>` elements as children of `<tr>`.

### Benefits:
- Fixed the hydration error in the Purchase Order Detail page
- Maintained the reusability of the custom table components
- Ensured valid HTML structure that renders consistently
- Preserved the component abstraction for better code organization
- Fixed issues in both the PurchaseOrderDetailPage and ItemsSection components

### Summary:
The hydration error was caused by invalid HTML structure in our table components. Our attempts to fix whitespace issues with React.createElement actually created more problems by generating invalid HTML nesting.

The solution was to revert to the original JSX implementation of the CustomTable components, which ensures that the proper HTML structure is maintained. This approach preserves the reusability and abstraction of the custom components while ensuring valid HTML structure that renders consistently between the server and client.

## New Task: Fix Purchase Order Detail Page Data Display - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
The purchase order detail page wasn't populating the data from the purchase voucher that was filled out. The page was not correctly displaying the purchase order details.

### Root Cause:
After examining the code, we identified that there was a mismatch between the data structure expected in the PurchaseOrderDetailPage component and what was being returned from the API. The component was expecting fields like `supplierName` directly, but the API returns a more complex structure with nested objects.

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Added console logging to understand the actual API response structure
2. ✅ Updated the data extraction logic to properly map API fields to display fields:
   ```javascript
   const {
     supplier,
     purchaseOrderNumber,
     date,
     dueDate,
     referenceNo,
     billNumber,
     supplierInvoiceReferenceNo,
     currency,
     exchangeRateToNPR,
     isImport,
     items: purchaseItems
   } = purchaseOrder;
   ```
3. ✅ Added proper handling for nested objects:
   ```javascript
   // Format the items array for display
   const items = purchaseItems?.map(item => ({
     productName: item.item?.name || 'Unknown Product',
     productCode: item.item?._id || 'No Code',
     qty: item.quantity || 0,
     rate: item.price || 0,
     discount: item.discount || 0,
     tax: item.tax || 0,
     amount: (item.quantity || 0) * (item.price || 0)
   })) || [];
   
   // Get supplier name
   const supplierName = typeof supplier === 'object' ? supplier.name : supplier;
   ```
4. ✅ Added proper formatting for dates and numbers:
   ```javascript
   <div>{date ? new Date(date).toLocaleDateString() : 'N/A'}</div>
   ```
5. ✅ Added fallback values for missing fields:
   ```javascript
   <div>{supplierName || 'N/A'}</div>
   ```
6. ✅ Updated the display section to show all relevant fields from the purchase order, including:
   - Purchase Order Number
   - Supplier Name
   - Reference Number
   - Bill Number
   - Date and Due Date
   - Currency and Exchange Rate
   - Total Amount
   - Items with their details

### Benefits:
- The purchase order detail page now correctly displays all the data from the purchase voucher
- Improved error handling with fallback values for missing fields
- Better formatting for dates and numbers
- Proper handling of nested objects in the API response
- More comprehensive display of purchase order details

## New Task: Fix Purchase Order Creation Error - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
When trying to create a purchase order, the following error occurs:
```
Error creating purchase order: Error: PurchaseOrder validation failed: purchaseOrderNumber: Path `purchaseOrderNumber` is required.
```

### Root Cause:
The `purchaseOrderNumber` field is required in the PurchaseOrder schema, but it was not being properly passed to the server or was being overwritten during the creation process.

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Added safeguards in the API route to ensure `purchaseOrderNumber` is always set:
   ```javascript
   // Ensure purchaseOrderNumber is set
   if (!purchaseOrderData.purchaseOrderNumber) {
     purchaseOrderData.purchaseOrderNumber = `PO-${Date.now()}`;
   }
   ```

2. ✅ Improved the purchase order creation in the add-purchase-bill page:
   ```javascript
   // Generate a unique purchase order number
   const timestamp = Date.now();
   const purchaseOrderNumber = `PO-${timestamp}`;
   
   // Construct the data object to send to the API
   const dataToSend = {
     purchaseOrderNumber: purchaseOrderNumber,
     // other fields...
   };
   ```

3. ✅ Added better error handling in the API route to provide more detailed error messages:
   ```javascript
   if (error.name === 'ValidationError') {
     const validationErrors = Object.keys(error.errors).map(field => {
       return `${field}: ${error.errors[field].message}`;
     });
     errorMessage = `Validation failed: ${validationErrors.join(', ')}`;
   }
   ```

4. ✅ Added logging to help diagnose issues:
   ```javascript
   // Log the data being sent to the database
   console.log("Purchase Order Data to save:", {
     ...purchaseOrderData,
     organization: organizationId,
     status: 'DRAFT'
   });
   ```

### Benefits:
- Fixed the validation error when creating purchase orders
- Ensured that the `purchaseOrderNumber` field is always set with a unique value
- Improved error handling with more detailed error messages
- Added logging to help diagnose issues in the future
- Made the purchase order creation process more robust

## New Task: Fix Purchase Order Detail Page Data Display - IN PROGRESS

### Issue:
The purchase order detail page isn't populating the data from the purchase voucher that was filled out. The page is not correctly displaying the purchase order details.

### Root Cause:
After examining the code, we identified that there's a mismatch between the data structure expected in the PurchaseOrderDetailPage component and what's being returned from the API. The component was expecting fields like `supplierName` directly, but the API returns a more complex structure with nested objects.

### Solution Plan:
1. ✅ Add console logging to understand the actual API response structure
2. ✅ Update the data extraction logic to properly map API fields to display fields
3. ✅ Handle nested objects like supplier and items correctly
4. ✅ Add proper formatting for dates and numbers
5. ✅ Add fallback values for missing fields
6. ✅ Update the display section to show all relevant fields from the purchase order

## New Task: Fix Hydration Issue in Purchase Bills Page Table - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
The purchase bills page was experiencing a hydration error in the table component, similar to the issue previously fixed in the Purchase Order Detail page. The specific error was: "In HTML, whitespace text nodes cannot be a child of <tr>. Make sure you don't have any extra whitespace between tags on each line of your source code."

### Root Cause:
The error was caused by whitespace text nodes being children of `<tr>` elements, which is not allowed in HTML. Additionally, there were potential issues with null values in the table data that could cause hydration mismatches between server and client rendering.

### Initial Solution:
1. ✅ Removed unnecessary comments and whitespace in the table JSX structure
2. ✅ Added fallback for null values in the table cells:
   ```javascript
   <CustomTableCell>{bill.referenceNo || ''}</CustomTableCell>
   ```
3. ✅ Updated the CustomTableCell component to handle null/undefined children:
   ```javascript
   export function CustomTableCell({ children, className }) {
     return (
       <td className={`p-4 align-middle [&:has([role=checkbox])]:pr-0 ${className || ''}`}>
         {children || ''}
       </td>
     );
   }
   ```
4. ✅ Ensured proper nesting of HTML elements in the table structure

### Enhanced Solution:
The issue persisted, so we implemented a more robust solution:

1. ✅ Completely restructured the table JSX in purchase-bills/page.jsx:
   - Placed each table cell on its own line to improve readability
   - Ensured proper indentation to make the structure clear
   - Removed all inline comments that could introduce whitespace

2. ✅ Enhanced the CustomTableRow component to actively filter out whitespace:
   ```javascript
   export function CustomTableRow({ children, className }) {
     // Ensure children is an array and filter out any text nodes that are just whitespace
     const filteredChildren = React.Children.toArray(children).filter(child => 
       typeof child !== 'string' || child.trim() !== ''
     );
     
     return (<tr className={`border-b transition-colors hover:bg-muted/50 data-[state=selected]:bg-muted ${className || ''}`}>{filteredChildren}</tr>);
   }
   ```

### Benefits:
- Fixed the hydration error in the Purchase Bills page table
- Improved handling of null/undefined values in table cells
- Actively filters out whitespace text nodes that could cause hydration issues
- Ensured valid HTML structure that renders consistently between server and client
- Maintained the reusability of the custom table components
- Prevented potential future hydration issues with similar table structures
- Improved code readability with better formatting

## New Task: Fix Nested Form Hydration Error in Sales Bill Page - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
The add-sales-bill page was experiencing a hydration error with the message: "In HTML, <form> cannot be a descendant of <form>. This will cause a hydration error." The error was occurring because the AddCustomerModal component contained a form that was nested inside the main form of the AddSalesBillPage component.

### Root Cause:
HTML does not allow nesting of form elements. In the application, the AddSalesBillPage component had a form that wrapped the entire page content, including the CustomerSection component. When the AddCustomerModal was opened from the CustomerSection, it created another form inside the existing form, which is invalid HTML and causes hydration errors.

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Removed the form element from the AddCustomerModal component:
   ```javascript
   // Changed from:
   <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
     {/* form content */}
   </form>
   
   // To:
   <div className="space-y-4">
     {/* form content */}
   </div>
   ```

2. ✅ Modified the submit button to call the handleSubmit function directly:
   ```javascript
   // Changed from:
   <Button type="submit" disabled={isLoading}>
     {isLoading ? 'Creating...' : 'Create Customer'}
   </Button>
   
   // To:
   <Button type="button" onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={isLoading}>
     {isLoading ? 'Creating...' : 'Create Customer'}
   </Button>
   ```

3. ✅ Updated the handleSubmit function to handle being called directly:
   ```javascript
   const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
     if (e) e.preventDefault(); // Make e optional since we might call directly
     // Rest of the function remains the same
   };
   ```

### Benefits:
- Fixed the hydration error caused by nested forms
- Maintained the same functionality without using nested form elements
- Ensured valid HTML structure that renders consistently between server and client
- Improved the robustness of the modal component
- Prevented similar issues in other parts of the application that might use the same pattern

## New Task: Fix JWT Token Verification in Auth Middleware - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
The auth middleware was failing to verify JWT tokens with the error: "Error [JsonWebTokenError]: invalid token". This was preventing API routes from working correctly, particularly the suppliers API route.

### Root Cause:
The issue was caused by how the JWT token was being stored and retrieved from cookies. The token was being stored as a JSON array in the cookie (`["token"]`), but when retrieved, it wasn't being properly extracted from this array format. Additionally, there were inconsistencies in how the token was being handled across different parts of the application.

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Updated the auth middleware to handle different token formats:
   ```javascript
   // First try the direct token cookie (new format)
   if (!token && req.cookies.has('sb-mnvxxmmrlvjgpnhditxc-auth-token')) {
       const cookieValue = req.cookies.get('sb-mnvxxmmrlvjgpnhditxc-auth-token').value;
       
       // Check if the cookie value is a valid JWT (should have 3 parts separated by dots)
       if (typeof cookieValue === 'string' && cookieValue.split('.').length === 3) {
           token = cookieValue;
           console.log('Auth middleware: Using direct token from cookie');
       } else {
           // Try to parse as JSON array if not a direct token
           try {
               const cookieArray = JSON.parse(cookieValue);
               if (Array.isArray(cookieArray) && cookieArray.length > 0) {
                   token = cookieArray[0];
               }
           } catch (parseError) {
               // If parsing fails, try using the raw value as fallback
               if (cookieValue.includes('.')) {
                   token = cookieValue;
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. ✅ Added token cleaning logic to handle potential format issues:
   ```javascript
   // Check if token is a string and clean it if needed
   if (typeof token !== 'string') {
     console.error('Auth middleware: Token is not a string:', typeof token);
     return NextResponse.json({ message: 'Invalid token format' }, { status: 401 });
   }
   
   // Remove any surrounding quotes or brackets that might have been included
   let cleanToken = token;
   if (token.startsWith('[') && token.endsWith(']')) {
     try {
       // Try to parse as JSON array and get first element
       const tokenArray = JSON.parse(token);
       if (Array.isArray(tokenArray) && tokenArray.length > 0) {
         cleanToken = tokenArray[0];
       }
     } catch (e) {
       // If parsing fails, try a simple string cleanup
       cleanToken = token.replace(/^\["|"\]$/g, '').replace(/^"|"$/g, '');
     }
   }
   ```

3. ✅ Updated the login and switch-organization routes to store the token directly:
   ```javascript
   // Store the token directly without wrapping in an array to avoid parsing issues
   const cookieValue = token;
   response.cookies.set('sb-mnvxxmmrlvjgpnhditxc-auth-token', cookieValue, cookieOptions);
   
   // For backward compatibility, also set the array format in a different cookie
   const arrayFormatCookie = JSON.stringify([token]);
   response.cookies.set('sb-mnvxxmmrlvjgpnhditxc-auth-token-array', arrayFormatCookie, cookieOptions);
   ```

### Benefits:
- Fixed the JWT token verification error in the auth middleware
- Made the token handling more robust by supporting multiple formats
- Improved error handling and logging for authentication issues
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing code that might expect the array format
- Simplified the token storage by using a direct string format
- Added better debugging information through console logs

## New Task: Fix Supplier Details Fetching in Purchase Forms - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
When selecting a supplier in the purchase forms, the application was failing to fetch the supplier details with the error: "Error fetching supplier details: Supplier not found". This was preventing users from seeing supplier information after selection.

### Root Cause:
The API call to fetch supplier details in the `supplier-section.jsx` component was not including the authentication token in the request headers. Additionally, the supplier API route was not correctly using the organization ID from the JWT token.

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Updated the `fetchSupplierDetails` function in `supplier-section.jsx` to include the authentication token:
   ```javascript
   // Retrieve the JWT from the cookie
   const authToken = getCookie('sb-mnvxxmmrlvjgpnhditxc-auth-token');
   
   // Make the API call with the authentication token
   const response = await fetch(`/api/organization/suppliers/${supplierId}`, {
     headers: {
       'Authorization': `Bearer ${authToken}`, // Include the JWT in the Authorization header
       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
     },
   });
   ```

2. ✅ Fixed the organization ID handling in the supplier API route:
   ```javascript
   // Get the organization ID from the request object (set by the auth middleware)
   let organizationId = req.organizationId;
   
   // If no organizationId in the token, try to get it from the user's organizations array
   if (!organizationId && req.user && req.user.organizations && req.user.organizations.length > 0) {
     organizationId = req.user.organizations[0];
   }
   ```

3. ✅ Added better error handling and logging for debugging:
   ```javascript
   console.log("SupplierDetails: Using auth token:", authToken ? authToken.substring(0, 10) + '...' : 'null');
   console.log("SupplierDetails: Fetch response status:", response.status);
   
   if (response.ok) {
     const fetchedSupplier = result.supplier;
     console.log("SupplierDetails: Successfully fetched supplier:", fetchedSupplier.name);
     // ...
   }
   ```

### Benefits:
- Fixed the supplier details fetching in purchase forms
- Ensured proper authentication for API calls
- Improved organization context handling
- Added better error handling and debugging information
- Enhanced user experience by showing supplier details after selection
- Prevented unnecessary API errors in the console

## New Task: Fix useEffect Dependency Array in Supplier Section - COMPLETED ✅

### Issue:
The console was showing an error: "The final argument passed to useEffect changed size between renders. The order and size of this array must remain constant. Previous: [681371318d2f2018ad14a677] Incoming: [681371318d2f2018ad14a677, [object Object]]"

### Root Cause:
The `router` object was included in the dependency array of the `useEffect` hook that fetches supplier details. Since the router object can change between renders, it was causing the dependency array to change size, which violates React's rules for useEffect.

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Removed the `router` object from the dependency array:
   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     // Fetch supplier details function
     // ...
   }, [formData.supplierName]); // Only depend on the supplier ID
   ```

2. ✅ Modified the redirect logic to use `window.location` instead of the Next.js router:
   ```javascript
   // If unauthorized, redirect to login
   if (response.status === 401 || response.status === 403) {
     console.error(`SupplierDetails: Authorization error (${response.status}). Redirecting to login.`);
     // Use window.location for navigation instead of router to avoid dependency
     window.location.href = '/auth/login';
   }
   ```

### Benefits:
- Fixed the React warning about inconsistent dependency array size
- Maintained the same functionality without introducing dependencies that change between renders
- Improved code stability and prevented potential memory leaks
- Followed React best practices for useEffect hooks
- Simplified the component's dependency tracking

## New Task: Implement Sales Functionality Similar to Purchases - COMPLETED ✅

### Requirements:
1. ✅ Create a sales module with a similar structure to the purchases module
2. ✅ Create a new Customer model (considering that suppliers can sometimes be customers too)
3. ✅ Implement sales orders and sales bills functionality similar to purchase orders and purchase bills
4. ✅ Reuse components where possible, adapting them for the sales context

### Implementation Plan:
1. ✅ Create the Customer model in the database
2. ✅ Create the SalesOrder and SalesBill models
3. ✅ Set up the directory structure for the sales module
4. ✅ Create API routes for sales orders and bills
5. ✅ Implement the UI components for sales
6. ✅ Add navigation links for the sales module

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Created a new Customer model with a relationship to Supplier:
   ```javascript
   const customerSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     name: {
       type: String,
       required: true,
     },
     contactType: {
       type: String,
       required: true,
     },
     // Other fields...
     relatedSupplier: {
       type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
       ref: 'Supplier',
     },
     organization: {
       type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
       ref: 'Organization',
       required: true,
     },
   });
   ```

2. ✅ Created SalesOrder and SalesBill models similar to PurchaseOrder and PurchaseBill:
   ```javascript
   const salesOrderSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
     salesOrderNumber: {
       type: String,
       required: true,
       unique: true,
     },
     customer: {
       type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
       ref: 'Customer',
       required: true,
     },
     // Other fields...
     status: {
       type: String,
       enum: ['DRAFT', 'APPROVED', 'CANCELLED'],
       default: 'DRAFT',
       required: true,
     },
